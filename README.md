Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the Benin Malanville weather and solar radiation dataset. This dataset comprises detailed measurements of various meteorological parameters recorded over a substantial period, enabling a comprehensive analysis of solar potential and environmental conditions. The dataset is crucial for understanding the factors influencing solar energy generation and determining optimal locations for solar installations in Benin.

Data Variables
The dataset includes the following key variables:

Timestamp: The date and time at which the measurements were recorded. It provides a chronological context for the data.

Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) [W/m²]: The total amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface. High GHI values indicate strong solar energy potential.

Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) [W/m²]: The amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the sun's rays. DNI is crucial for concentrated solar power (CSP) systems.

Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) [W/m²]: The solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface that is scattered by the atmosphere. DHI ensures some solar energy availability even on cloudy days.

ModA: Sensor readings related to solar module A. It helps in assessing the performance and efficiency of the solar panels.

ModB: Sensor readings related to solar module B. Similar to ModA, it helps evaluate the performance and efficiency of the solar panels.

Ambient Temperature (Tamb) [°C]: The temperature of the air surrounding the solar panels. It influences the efficiency and performance of the solar panels.

Relative Humidity (RH) [%]: The percentage of humidity in the air. RH can impact the performance and cooling of solar panels.

Wind Speed (WS) [m/s]: The speed of the wind. Wind speed can affect the cooling of solar panels and their efficiency.

Wind Gust (WSgust) [m/s]: The highest wind speed recorded in a short period. Wind gusts can impact the stability and performance of solar panels.

Wind Speed Standard Deviation (WSstdev) [m/s]: The variability of wind speed over a period. It helps understand the fluctuations in wind conditions.

Wind Direction (WD) [°]: The direction from which the wind is blowing. It can influence the placement and orientation of solar panels.

Wind Direction Standard Deviation (WDstdev) [°]: The variability of wind direction. It helps understand the fluctuations in wind patterns.

Barometric Pressure (BP) [hPa]: The atmospheric pressure. It can affect weather patterns and solar radiation levels.

Cleaning: An indicator of whether the solar panels were cleaned. Cleaning can impact the efficiency and performance of the solar panels.

Precipitation: The amount of precipitation recorded. It can impact the solar radiation and the performance of the solar panels.

Module Temperature A (TModA) [°C]: The temperature of solar module A. It is crucial for assessing the operating conditions of the solar panels.

Module Temperature B (TModB) [°C]: The temperature of solar module B. Similar to TModA, it is important for evaluating the operating conditions of the solar panels.

These variables were analyzed to identify the best location for solar system installation, based on the data collected from Benin Malanville. The analysis included time series trends, correlation analysis, Z-score outlier detection, and visualizations such as histograms, bubble charts, and wind roses to provide a comprehensive understanding of the solar potential and environmental conditions.
